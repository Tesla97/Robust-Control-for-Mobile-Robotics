# Vehicle-Control
In this repository all my projects about the design of regulator for vehicles control.

First Project is about Lateral Vehicle Dynamics. 
In particular I've designed from zero a Lane Keeping System, in particular an H infinity controller.
More intersting is the fact that I've written a Path Planning Algorithm for defining the steering angle from the measurements obtained by cameras.
